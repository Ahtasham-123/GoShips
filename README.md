# Project name is GoShips.
this project is dropshipment project.
Dropshipping is a type of retail fulfillment method for online stores, where instead of warehousing inventory, merchants purchase products from third-party suppliers as customers make orders. The products are then shipped directly to the consumer. This way, the seller doesnâ€™t have to handle the product directly.
